Why hello there!

Welcome to Trouvaille, a Grand Rapids based project focused on documenting the stories of people and places. As of right now, this is a one person show, with the goal of preserving interesting and important bits of history, and pulling together a more comprehensive story using the fragments from different sources.

>: a lucky find.

I believe that every story is an important one. The bad stories saved as cautionary tales, and the good ones as stories to be passed down through generations. It is also a way to keep the stories of families and ancestors alive, and commemorate sacrifices and successes. I also hope this can just be an interesting insight into our city, just as much as it was for me. Now it's almost hard not to see the scars history has left on the streets.

Since we're using fancy words, please enjoy this project, as it's made with meraki.
