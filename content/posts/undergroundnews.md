On the surface, Grand Rapids is your average conservative city, bearing the marks of Dutch Calvinism to this very day. The news was no exception. Due to this gap, some took to starting their own news platforms and newspapers. Because of their ties to the New Left and their lack of backing by existing establishments, these papers garnered their own name: The Underground Press. While some, like the *New River Free Press*, disliked the label for it's negative connotations, others, like the *Root*, embraced it. The majority of these newspapers appeared during the early 70s, with the rise in counter culture movements and anti-Vietnam War protests. Many of these newspapers were either too small to garner much public attention, or whose issues were simply lost to time. The exceptions are the *Root*, a newspaper running from approximately 1971-72, and the *New River Free Press*, which ran from 1973-1977. These papers in Grand Rapids were not unique. Rather, they were inspired by counterparts like the *Berkeley tribe*, who paved the way for a new generation and a new movement to sweep across the United States.

### Underground Press in the United States
For clarity reasons, I will refer to this genre of newspaper as the Underground Press, but not everyone views these newspapers the same. Some wore the badge with pride, while others felt it mislabeled them and portrayed them in a negative light.

Another thing to clear up, the movement I'm refering to is the one in the late 90s, but underground newspapers existed even as far back as the invention of the printing press. The invention of the press enabled people with unconventional views to publish their own writings that might have conflicted with certain religious ideas. In the United States, however, underground newspapers were not illegal, but rather a symbol of counterculture. Many of these newspapers discussed unpopular ideas like drugs, witchcraft, and some advertised protests or boycotts. With the New Left growing more popular with younger generations, as well as the draft for the Vietnam war, this began to trickle down into smaller cities, like Grand Rapids.

The Underground Press often attracted the attention of Federal Agencies like the FBI, especially within groups that advocated for violence or criminal activities. Much of this involvement was hidden and not covered by the media, who saw no need to lend paper space to those who had so violently attacked traditional press. These attacks even seemed to just be a coincedence, leading many to just assume the targets were paranoid and playing victim. A New York Times article from 1970 talked about how people distributed papers apart of the New Left or anti-war movements would find themselves arrested on loitering (or similiar) charges. Even thought the majority of these cases were dismissed, these papers would have to spend the time and the money dealing with the court. This created an atmosphere of fear and put pressure on the newspaper to find new ways to distribute.

An [excellent article](https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/unameractrips.html#ref33) by Geoffrey Rips covers this topic of suppression on a much deeper level, and if that's an interesting topic for you, I'd recommend that as a read. The general gist of the lengthy article documents the level of FBI interference and sometimes illegal activities in its attempt to try and stop the spread of counterculture ideas. While this influence probably didn't spread to our little town of Grand Rapids, these events give a bit of insight into the behind the scenes of the 1970s.

### The Root
The first issue of *the Root* that GRPL has is from February, 1971. Upon looking through the pages, the words have both a serious weight to them as authors discuss things like war and politics, but there is also a bit of sarcasm and humor scattered about. One of the subscription forms specifies that you cannot sign up with green crayon. The form also proclaims that it can deliver newspapers to your door, and if your door can't read, to you! Goofiness aside, *the Root* existed to fill in the gaps that the Press had left behind, and discussed many controversial topics, such as anti-war sentiments, witchcraft, climate change, abortion advice, gay rights, womens rights, prison activism, and racial injustice. The paper also had smaller articles on music and sports, and regularly ran one called "High", where readers could inform the paper on bad drugs being sold. The newspaper seemed to accept it's status as an Underground Newspaper and wore it like a badge of honor.

In Volume 1, issue 5, the paper describes their staff as diverse and as, "blue and white collar workers, teachers, students, housewives, welfare recipients, social workers, waitresses..." Around 30 people were involved in the making of the paper, but only around 10 actually had their names listed. For a more comprehensive spreadsheet, go [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMUCrxXi1OT-_Mr1-zEvalGfa_6k1r5z1YBp6Hi7i5g/edit?usp=sharing). 

*the Root* also occasionally gave accounts of times when they had been harrassed, or when their distrubution attempts had been shut down. It can be assumed that some distributers of the newspaper were high schoolers, when in one of the articles the author notes that students were concerned that they would be suspended or expelled for selling them. Some students were even expelled for participating in protests or marches, as GRPS did not allow students to attend. *the Root* recounted such experiences with a negative light and disproving tone, citing the right to protest and the right to freedom of speech. There was also a rather scathing article written about Catholic Central, mocking the school's censorship of controversial Bible quotes and alledged suppression of the school's newspapers. Regardless of whether such incidents happened or were as they were made out to be, they pretty accurately display what *the Root* stood for and what else was also published.

Just like across the United States, the underground press really only represented a fairly small sample of the population, hence why they are "underground". Although representing counterculture in Grand Rapids, the city continued to be fairly conservative throught the millenia. Malls didn't really appreciate the attempts to solicite donations, and apparently the Santa Claus at North Kent Mall didn't wish for a copy of the paper. The paper's most successful distribution efforts came from outside bars, but even then they were requested to stand across the street or on the corner. It is generally frowned upon to sell things directly outside (or inside) a business, so these requests really don't come as that big of a surprise. The paper did not feel the same way, and were considering legal action to continue to fight for their rights. What came of this is unknown, as they never bothered to write a follow up.

There isn't really any information on when *the Root* shut down. The newspaper had been asking for money donations since the very beginning, but they were able to at least publish 4 more issues of volume 2. It's also most likely that it finished not too long after this 4th issue, especially in light of the shutdowns of other newspapers around the same time. Even though the person donating the papers to the library did miss a few editions, they were fairly consistent. Not only this, but the address *the Root* was at, 449 Jefferson St., was eventually demolished on May 25, 1989.

An interesting tidbit of information is that The Salt, another underground newspaper in Grand Rapids, started up in October/November of 1972. An article in their first issue is written by "Mary Lu Heard", someone who also wrote for *the Root*. As counterculture most likely didn't just disappear with the newspaper, writers could have moved to other outlets to continue to express their ideas in the way they new most. Perhaps a small group of staff founded or moved to a new newspaper after the dissolution of their old.

### The New River Free Press
A newspaper running much longer than the *Root*, all 39 issues [^3] of the *New River Free Press* are available to the public online for free, [here](https://digital.grpl.org/Browse/Objects/facet/collection_facet/id/6/view/images) [^4]. This newspaper is different from the *Root* in many ways. The *New River Free Press* was actually donated to the GRPL by the publisher of the newspaper, Michael Chacko
Daniels. Michael is an Indian Protestant who still writes books and has his own website (albeit not updated since around 2017-18), which you can find [here](http://indiawritingstation.com/). A librarian informed me during my visit that the paper didn't really appreciate being called an underground newspaper due to the terms negative connotations. This newspaper had a more narrow focus, writing primarily about Grand Rapids, Michigan, and occasionally about the United States. There were also multiple interviews with community members and politicians, including one of the city commissioners, and Richard Vander Veen, a congressman for Michigan. 

The newspaper covered many things that they saw wrong with Grand Rapids, and addressed issues such as affordable housing, civil rights, the environment, local government, and acted as a guide to the urban area. The paper was founded due to the authors feeling that there was no real way to make themselves heard, other than to take matters into their own hands.

**A brief history of the NRFP was provided in the finding aid of the collection, but I thought I'd include it here with some paraphrasing. If you'd like to read the whole thing, visit the [finding aid](https://www.grpl.org/uploads/grhsc/500.pdf).**
>A brief history of the New River Free Press by Michael Chacko Daniels: 
>
>At the core of the short history of the New River Free Press is the love story of two immigrants: one, an Indian Protestant — Michael Chacko Daniels, who became its editor and publisher in June 1974; the other, a Polish Catholic—Teresa Podgorski, who became its advertising manager. [...] Michael was born in 1943 to south Indian migrants in Aden, when it was under the British. 
>
>He grew up in Bombay (1944-1967), where his father was a renowned newspaperman and a deacon of the Bombay Baptist Church. [...] In 1967, Michael came to the United States and earned a master's degree at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism within a year. He then worked as an assistant editor for The Asia Foundation in San Francisco for four years. In 1973 Michael joined the US Government's domestic "War on Poverty" as a Volunteer In Service To America (VISTA) participant. He was sent to work at the Grand Rapids Urban League Tenants Union. This assignment included joining a coalition of agencies working on fair housing issues. Activities included exposing redlining and preventing the further destruction of Black neighborhoods in Grand Rapids' central city.
>
>At the coalition's meetings, Michael got to know Teresa, who was then an urban agent for Kent County Community Action Program's North East Complex. Her strong social justice commitments and history of speaking truth to power impressed him. Michael firmly believed that if he hadn't gotten to know and trust Teresa's commitments, he wouldn't have gone, after just a short time in Grand Rapids, to meet Joyce Hodge Stellema and her collaborators. They were planning to start a free community newspaper focused on social justice issues, for which, Teresa said, he would be a perfect fit. Because of Teresa's introduction, Joyce and her collaborators welcomed Michael into their group. During his year as a volunteer, out of deference to the requirements of his local VISTA-sponsoring agency, Daniels appeared in New River's staff credits and non-poetry bylines as "Chiki," "Shanti," "Citywatcher," or just "Michael." His full name appeared in the newspaper's commentaries and interviews only after June 1974, when he was no longer a VISTA.
>
>In August 1974, Michael and Teresa got married under a tree in Kent County's Johnson Park and lived on Carlton Ave, from where they produced New River until its "Goodbye" issue in May 1977, when they signed off with ... a note of thanks by Michael [...]. 
*The "Goodbye" issue can be found [here](https://digital.grpl.org/Detail/objects/10871).*

### The Others
There were a few other newspapers operating in Grand Rapids around this time, but most don't have many available copies or really any available history. Some papers, like the *Sage*, didn't really provide much actual news, but rather provided an outlet for less popular ideas like witchcraft and marketed themselves as a positive lifestyle journal. To be honest, I found the *Sage* to be the most boring, probably since I had just entertained myself with trying to dig up the history of the *Root*. Another paper, *Sound of the Watchman's Trumpet* doesn't really seem to fit the bill of a newspaper. There was no actual news contained in the paper, but instead was more of a religious publication discussing the end of times. The paper was apparently published monthly by Michigan for Christ, but only one edition is available. The other papers in this box were pretty similar to the ones already discussed, but just didn't have enough information available for me to talk about in length.

## Now what?
Both the *Root* and the *New River Free Press* existed because they saw issues in the lack of representative press in Grand Rapids, and because they felt that the opinions of minorities were being hidden amid a wave of political conservatism. Things have changed in Grand Rapids, but that doesn't mean that they've changed for the better, or that newspapers have gotten much better at representation. If we are going off of Yelp! reviews alone, I don't think the Grand Rapids Press is well liked.

![Grand Rapids Press with 1.5 stars on Yelp](/trouvaille/grandrapidspress.png)
*I know, I know, only 4 ratings. To be fair, the other 15 ratings that were listed as "not currently recommended" basically said the same things*

To be 100% honest, I have no idea what to suggest as a solution at all. The press in America has become more and more segragated, with different political stances causing a lot of turmoil in the ultimate game of "I'm right and you're wrong!" Maybe it's our job as citizens to advocate for those who lack voices, and open up our ears to things we might not really want to hear. Of course, easier said than done, but I hope this article at least serves as a reminder that there are counterculture movements (albeit with different names) that exist outside the realm of traditional news, and that there may be things happening in Grand Rapids that don't fit with the traditional narrative. Perhaps we can welcome these people, as long as they too choose not to create a city of hatred.

[^1]: I also could have forgotten to write the year, and just assumed I'd remember. Either way, there is no real reason for the articles to suddenly come from a different year.
[^2]: This time there actually wasn't a year.
[^3]: According to the finding aid, there is "no copy" of the August 1975 edition. I'm assuming this just means that the publisher didn't have this edition, but it also seems like there might not been an August edition.
[^4]: If you are looking for the collection in the library, it's Collection 500. The finding aid is available [here](https://www.grpl.org/uploads/grhsc/500.pdf), and it also gives a nice description of the newspaper and the creators.
