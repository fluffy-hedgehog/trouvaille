Of course, I don't mean the roots of music or entertainment in a macro sense, that would be a bit far from the purpose of this project. Rather, I mean the roots of the establishments that provided entertainment to the Rapidians, from then to now. With many established communities, entertainment was the next step in a growing city. As the entertainment sphere changed across America, many of these things were reflected in Grand Rapids. Opera Houses gave way to theaters, eventually to form Celebration Cinema. Our very own theme park became East Grand Rapids, and our many bands and orchestras shifted over time to less central city-wide type performances. 

This article is a collection of mini essays on different entertainments in Grand Rapids. There isn't an end, but rather more will continue to be added as more research is done.

## Establishments

Before we begin, it is important to differentiate between the variety of establishments and bands/orchestras. Establishments are ones like Powers' Opera House, a place that is not a single entity but instead might host variest musical groups and typically have their own building or meeting place. An establishment also usually has a variety of acts. The Bands and Musical Groups are groups operating under a single identity, and usually performs for other places.

### Power's Opera House (or Powers' Opera House)

Unlike what the name suggests, the Power's Opera House hosted a variety of entertainment, from theater and stage plays, to operas and concerts. William T. Powers first built the Opera house between 1873-1874, and it was opened on Tuesday, May 12, 1874. It carried the name "Power's Opera House" as well as "Power's Grand Opera House". The latter name came when William Powers retired in May, 1887, and Mr. Fred Berger arrived. The Opera House went through many changes and fires. To view a full timeline of events, there is a very comprehensive article by [James Winslow Di Piazza](https://powersbehindgr.wordpress.com/powers-theatre/) that has a lot of details about said events.

*A supposed 1936 photo I found in a random comment section courtesy of ["kencmcintyre"](http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/22322). I will update this if proper image credits are found, but a reverse image search yielded nothing.*

By 1944, Jack Loeks rented out the Opera House and opened his own theater, titled "Foto News". It was named Foto News due to the fact that Loeks was unable to show anything other than newsreels and select cartoons due to the fact that film companies could control who could display their movies. Jack Loeks ultimately joined the Hollywood Antitrust Case of 1948, which allowed many small theaters to finally be able to display big pictures.

In 1948, the theater closed and was remodeled. By December 25 that year, it reopened as "Midtown Theater", and continued to by operated by Loeks for multiple different owners, such as Goodrich/Murray, Butterfield, and Harry Sommers & Co. The theater could hold between 1,000 to 1,700 (numbers vary), and was supposed to have had "perfect acoustics". The theater ran until it's final performance of *Cabaret* , when it closed on Wednesday, September 20, 1972. The theater was then rented out for other groups and concerts, and in 1976 the Civic Players bought and began renovating for two years, but ultimately settled to demolish it. The building was finally demolished in January, 1979.

One fascinating detail is that Jack Loeks' legacy continues on today, in the form of Celebration! Cinemas, which is something that surprised me greatly. I suppose I never realized that the theater originated here in Grand Rapids, or that it tied at all to my research.

### Press Newsboy Band

Founded in 1893 by Willis H. Turner, the Newsboy Band thrived up until the 1923 when the bandleader, Professor J.M. Lafferty, died. The Newsboy band was something all newsboys strived to get into in order to get the opportunity to learn, from scratch, a musical instrument and to perform in everything from parades to banquets.

The band was a phenomanal success, to the point where it didn't just stay in Grand Rapids. In fact, the band traveled to Indianapolis in 1897 and played at a sellout concert. This concert may have sparked the formation of Indianapolis' own newsboy band, which had 350 children auditioning. John Philip Sousa alledgedly remarked, "It is something remarkable that, in so short a time three dozen untutored newsboys could be made to play so well. As a rule I abhor juvenile bands, but these little chaps delight me."

### Frank Wurzburg

Not much is found under the Furniture City Band, but when looking into the name "Frank Wurzburg", Mr. Wurzburg is said to be noted by the Grand Rapids Press to have been a very fine violinist. Alongside Chester and William Bronson, they formed Wurzburg and Bronson's Orchestra (or Wurzburg and Bronson's Millitary Band, although it's unclear if these were the same thing). George B. Newell was another band owner said to be one of the youngest, most popular, and most successful musical directors in the United States. Mr. Newell was a violinist in the Wurzburg Band and Orchestra (again unclear if these three were the same band or not), and was said to direct when Mr. Wurzburg allowed him too. With this, we can at least say this band existed as early as 1894 and as late as 1895, but most likely longer in either direction.

One final connection can be made. The Powers family (the same ones behind the Powers' Theater) were good friends with the Wurzburg family, making a connection between two great musical entertainers of Grand rapids. Fredrick Adolphus Wurzburg directed music in the Powers' Opera House in the 1880s for around 9 years. There is a wonderful [Wordpress site](https://powersbehindgr.wordpress.com/powers-theatre/wurzburg-family/) detailing the history of the Wurzburg family that gives more details.

### Ramona Park

Definitely one of the more famous entertainment pieces in Grand Rapids, Ramona Park was an amusement park located in what is now East Grand Rapids. The park was open from 1903-1954, and contained a roller coaster as well as other popular attractions. The park was run by the Grand Rapids Street Railway Company

[^1]: Thanks for forcing me to add a whole 'nother column just to include the date. I also hade to google if 'nother was gramatically correct. On a serious note, I can't tell if they meant "office" to be apart of location, or if their band was seriously called "Grand Rapids Letter Carrier’s Band Office". Whatever floats your boat, I suppose.
