When I chose to write about Immigration as the first step of my project to learn about Grand Rapids, I didn't expect it to be something easy. However, at the same time, I didn't expect it to be quite as difficult. In the initial batch of research that I did, I came away with a very patchwork understanding on the cultures and neighborhoods that came together to form the city. Each article that I read only gave me a look on a specific group of people, a set of facts, or even just a name. The interesting thing though, is that that segregation that I saw in those articles reflected the world of early Grand Rapids. In fact, that segregation and division even travels through to today.

This article will be divided into parts, with each part focusing on a different aspect of immigration. Most of my research focused on European immigration, but through further research I plan to add more focus on African Americans and minority groups. Through it all, I hope it will become clear that our differences are only what make us unique, not what should divide us. This article is by no means ever going to be fully complete. My original plan for the article has changed a lot, and this is not the first article I finished (even though it's the first one I started). The main reason I didn't finish right away was because of the daunting task of summarizing so much research and trying to talk about so many people at once. Coming back to it now with some experience under my belt, lets begin our journey into the past.

*While I will be giving a more brief description of different neighborhoods, I don't want to just sum up what books have done before. Thus, if you are looking to find a very detailed description of each neighborhood in Grand Rapids, vignettes and photos included, take a look at the book "Heart and Soul: The Story of Grand Rapids Neighborhoods" by Andrew Schrier and Linda Samuelson.*

## Part 1: The Very, Very Beginning

The very very earliest immigrants to what is now Grand Rapids would of course be Native Americans. The Hopewell were the very first people in the Grand Rapids area. Although Michigan doesn't have the most sophisticated settlements, there are numerous burial grounds such as the Norton Mound Group in Grand Rapids that have provided lots of information about these original Natives. More mounds existed on the West Side of the Grand River, but those were razed and replaced with railroads and factories. There are now a few recreation mounds in Grand Rapids (such as in Ah-Nab-Awen Park) to commemorate the loss.

![Ah-Nab-Awen Park Mound](/trouvaille/ahnabawenmound.jpg)
*Photo of Ah-Nab-Awen Park with a mound in the background*

The Hopewell tribe built mounds from 10 B.C. to 400 A.D., but after that, no one is quite sure where they went or why they stopped building. Although they may be the distant ancestors of modern tribes, the Hopewell tribe vanished, leaving much speculation in their wake. By the 1700s, the Ottowa tribes then settled in the Grand Rapids area and set up multiple villages, with the largest being right here in downtown Grand Rapids. After this, there is a 100 year gap between the Native Americans and European settlers. Just like so many interactions across the United States, Natives and Europeans did not get along. One quote [^1] from Louis Campau reads, 

>"A few white men came and there was little trouble. A few more white men arrived and there was more trouble. Then a lot came and the Indians became bad. Finally the Indians were relieved of their possesssions." 

Well thanks, Louis. At least he admits that the mistreatment of Native Americans did happen, and that we basically just stole a bunch of land from them.

The first non-native settlers in Grand Rapids were French-Canadians Joseph and Magdalene La Frambroise who built a fur trading post. Magdalene was mÃ©tis[^2], and was a descendent of the Odawa tribe. She and her husband moved to the Grand Rapids in 1806, where he was promptly murdered. Magdalene continued running their trading post there, and used her knowledge of Ottawa, French, English and Ojibwe to promot her business. A few other Europeans traveled to what is now Grand Rapids, but the most notable would most certainly be Louis Campau. Credited as the founder of Grand Rapids, Campau joined Isaac Mccoy in his mission station, and his suggestion "Grand Rapids" ended up being the name that was decided for the City. By the time Grand Rapids became a city in 1850, it had a population of 2,686 primarily European inhabitants. In 1858, Campau joined the negotions that ultimately made his nephew who was the sub-chief of an Odawa tribe, Cobmoosa, relocate to Oceana County in Michigan. Multiple sources recount Cobmoosa's way of walking, calling it elegant and majestic. 

>I am an Indian; and can be nothing else. I wish my people and children to be civilized. I know your ways are superior to ours, and my people must adopt them or die. But I cannot change. The young can adopt new ways; the old cannot. I shall soon pass away, living and dying an Indian. You can bend the young tree, but not the old oak.
>
> -Cobmoosa [^3]

Grand Rapids' early days did not include many immigrants. Even by 1870, the majority of people living in Grand Rapids were native born. 10,782 people were native and 5,725 were foreign born/immigrants, as listed by Albert Baxter[^4] Some Irish came in 1835 to start building the canals, and more came again in 1841 to further expand the canals. Aside from this, Albert Baxter states that further immigration was few and far between. In 1842, the City got together and decided that they wanted more immigration (well that's... new), and formed a comittee headed by John Ball. This lack of immigration was most likely the effect of certain reports made by a surveyer sent by Congress that claimed Michigan lacked vegetation, was overly swampy, and had narrow, sluggish streams. Baxter commented on said reports with a snide, "It is doubtful if that surveryor came far into Michigan." In 1845, John Almy and Edmund B. Bostwick wrote a pamphlet to immigrants to attract attention to the city. It was quite successful, as over the next few years, hundreds of Dutch moved to Michigan. While most settled in Holland, Michigan, a good portion moved to Grand Rapids. By 1854, the amount of Dutch arriving grew to be so great, they established their own immigration society to help poorer immigrants travel and settle in Grand Rapids.

The Irish were fairly steady in their arrival, ever since they were first invited to help build the canals. Those that came fled from political tensions in their home country around 1848. Baxter writes that these Irish still had strong ties to their families in their motherland, and often sent back remittances and relief supplies as much as they could. This created a steady stream of immigration to Michigan and subsequently Grand Rapids. 

>[The Irish] form a not inconsiderable factor of the population, assimilate readily under our customs and institutions, and in the main become a patriotic and energetic class of citizens.
>
> -Albert Baxter, 1891

Another major immigrant group were the Germans. The majority of Germans came after 1840, although some (including the Cordes family, who were the earliest and arrived in Grand Rapids in the winter of 1842-42) were here before the 1850s. The German population was eager to bring their drinks, culture, skills and music to the city, all of which have become integral to Grand Rapids. On October 6, 1883, the German natives celebrated the bicentennial anniversary of the landing in Germantown, which eventually became part of Philidelphia. This was one of, if not the first, German colonies and immigrants to America. Baxter noted that the celebration was huge, drawing a two-mile long procession, and a large trades display showing tradesmen with their accoutrements.

Another group of immigrants recorded by Baxter were the Scandinavians and Polish. Baxter refers to the fact that crops were poor in Sweden before 1870, which coincides with the Swedish famine that lasted from 1867-1869, which greatly increased Swedish immigration to the U.S., and subsequently Grand Rapids. Both Baxter and another book[^5] also point to the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad company sending Reverend J.P. Tustin to Sweden to advertise and attract construction workers to America to build railroads. They even offered 80 acres of land to the workers to form a the New Blekinge Colony, which is now Tustin, Michigan. "The Industrial Revolution in America" also states that after the construction of the railways, many of the Swedes left area, and it could be possible that these people then moved to Grand Rapids and other surrounding areas.

### Queen of the Poles
As for the Poles, not much is talked about by Baxter, but an article done by Eduard Skendzel, a piece from the Polish Eaglet, as well as earlier research that I did all consistently bring up one name: Valeria Lipczynski[^6]. She's often written about as *La Grande Dame Polonaise* (Queen of the Poles), or even the "Angel of Mercy". She, alongside her husband John, arrived in Grand Rapids on November 21, 1869. Mme. Lipczynski cites the reason she left Poland in one article, writing,

>In Poland we had no liberty. The Polish language was being suppressed. Only German was taught in schools. The government was trying to make Germans of us and of our children.

Arriving in America was a great relief for her and her family, as they could then have the freedom to speak Polish and practice their religion. The pair settled on the east side of the Grand River near the brickyards, or as they called it, the *Cegielnia*. John was able to work there as a master potter until he opened his own practice with Samuel Davis. Valeria and John were able to sponsor another 40 Polish families to come to Grand Rapids, and helped them intigrate into society. She served as a social worker, translator, tutor, midwife, nurse, intermediary with local officials, and godmother. She also was responsible for the formation of many organisations and churches, including St. Mary's, St. Adalbert's, and St. Isidore's, as well as the Wiarus Society and Society of Polish ladies.

When WWI arrived, Mme. Lipczynski used their home as a station for Polish relief work. She helped collect items and money to support her home country and to help free it. Through this, she was awarded the General Haller Swords metal, and the Polish government granted her the Golden Cross of Merit for her work in supporting the Polish people, and building the Polish society.

## Part 2: A taste of segregation
Although African Americans did not arrive in Grand Rapids very quickly, Grand Rapids was born ready to divide. As soon as the Dutch arrived, they began to settle in their own communities based on family ties or dialect. Rather than settle together as "Hollanders", they identified more as "Zeelanders", "Groningers", etc. This lead to neighborhoods being built on ethnic divides. Even as old disputes between different countries were forgotten, a new conflict arose, this time based on skin color.

![The Walking City - Ethnic Neighborhoods Map](/trouvaille/ethnicneighborhoods.jpg)
1. Germans were among the first immigrants to the city in the 1850s. Polish immigrants who spoke German settled easily among them from the 1870s on into the 20th century.

*Map and Footnotes from Heart and Soul: The Story of Grand Rapids Neighborhoods*

The above map serves a more visual representation of where different communities settled. Of course, as times changed, these neighborhoods changed too, but a lot of these neighborhoods are still prominent. In he Sacred Heart Polish neighborhood, the Polish Falcon society still bears a Polish Falcon. The Dutch heritage could potentially be why everyone is taller than me at school, which resides in a Dutch neighborhood.

Both the Almy & Bostwick pamphlet as well as Albertus C. VanRaalte were able to attract Dutch immigrants. The growing Dutch population reached a total of 53 housholds by June of 1850, which ended up dividing into two communities. One lived on the East side while the other lived on the West side. The East side Dutch work tended to work more in factories and the brickyard. By 1849, the first Dutch speaking congregation appeared, which was the Second Reformed Church. The Second Reformed Church split from the First, and shocker, led to the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth reformed churches being formed. Although the East siders and the Polish lived fairly close and even worked together, there was a distinct divide between the two ethnic groups. It was even said that "Good Dutch don't mix". The West side Dutch were primarily manual laborers in the furniture industry, and some became quite good at what they did. These people then went on to work as business people. The Leonard/Alpine area skyrocketed in the number of Dutch households during this time. 

The Germans were the second biggest ethnic group in Kent County, and in Grand Rapids, the majority worked as skilled laborers in factories on Canal St. At first they settled in that area as well, but due to the lack of adequete housing, most began to spread to the West side. One of the major contributions the Germans made in terms of culture was beer. Beer has been such a huge part of Grand Rapids history, to the point where we have won the last 3 Beer City U.S.A. titles in a row. Not only that, but there's a chance that beer has been brewed in Grand Rapids from as early as 1836, where a man by the name of John Pannell began to brew beer at the base of Prospect Hill. In 1883, multiple local breweries came together to form the Grand Rapids Brewing Company. 

One other major ethic group was the Lebanese[^8] community, who settled in Grand Rapids as early as 1890. Most of these immigrants came from Beirut or the Bekaa valley, looking for a better life. These people settled in the Market Street colony due to the cheap available housing. Because these immigrants mostly spoke only Arabic, they stuck together in their community to support each other. They were able to start their own businesses, many of which were successful enough for the business owners to send money back home to their relatives. Members of the community were extremely proud of their self sufficiency and their ability to support themselves from the very beginning. 

In the three ethnic groups discussed above, each had a very distinct area in which they settled. This cultural segregation is incredibly interesting, especially when compared to a housing map made by the Home Owner's Loan Corporation. The HOLC in 1937 created a map rating different areas of Grand Rapids on how nice they were to live in, the level of repair, etc. In the descriptions of the different neighborhoods, there was a section devoted to documenting the number of non native families living in that neighboorhood. First off, uncool. Neighborhoods with more non native families were listed by the HOLC as worse to live in. Second, the Ethnic Neighborhoods Map listed above still somewhat matches up with the ethnicities listed in certain areas by the 1937 map. The Grand Rapids Historical Commission has an [interactive version](http://www.historygrandrapids.org/tilemap/2596/the-holc-map) of the map available, and I highly recommend checking it out.

This early form of what was essentially redlining is what set the stage for even something even worse.

## Part 2.5: The Great Migration
Although life in Grand Rapids was difficult for all immigrants, people of color most faced the greatest difficulties being accepted into society. The Great Migration was a mass exodus of African Americans from the south to the north and western parts of America. The migration lasted from 1910 to around 1970, and Grand Rapids recieved it's fair share of immigrants as well. Although the north and west didn't blatantly discriminate as often as the South, it still wasn't necessarily a safe place for African Americans to travel or stay. A book by Victor H. Green titled ["The Negro Travelers Green Book" (1961 version)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/The_Travelers%27_Green_Book_1961.pdf) was written to help African Americans know where it was safe for them to travel and motels that they could safely stay in. While some towns in Michigan had many approved lodgings, Grand Rapids only had one: the Villa Court Motel.

I think the main reason this happened was because Grand Rapids didn't have a significant African American Population until around 1950, and even then, people were struggling to find the same level of work as their white counterparts.

*Table taken from [Higgins v. Board of Education, Grand Rapids](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/395/444/1416359/)*

A newspaper article from 1997 talked about some of the issues black people were facing when it came to getting jobs and homes.

> "Blacks were routinely passed over for promotion, or given positions with little to no authority. Their white counterparts, particularly in the skilled trades, guarded their positions zealously. According to one long time GM employee, some even set up screens around their work stations to prevent black collegues from picking up their techniques."

> *Grand Rapids Press* (23 February, 1997, p. 95)

Often, racism wore a polite face, manifesting in people "just trying to help", a change from what happened in the South. This hidden discrimination is a lot harder to track down, but that of course does not make it less real. Red-lining kept many African Americans in the inner city and away from white neighborhoods.

As I continue to add to this article during Black History Month, I have (for my own personal interest) been listening to different podcasts and others talk about random subjects. One I stumbled upon was the concept of a "sundown town". These towns were and are places where non-white[^7] people were not allowed after dark (or sundown). Curious, I simply googled "sundown town grand rapids". Although Grand Rapids was not listed anywhere as a potential sundown town, East Grand Rapids was. 

In 2015, Grand Rapids was listed the second worst city in the U.S. in terms of African American economic success, alongside many other manufacturing hubs that grew from the Great Migration. In 2016, Grand Rapids was also found to have the highest wealth gap of any city in the state. A [2021 news article](https://www.woodtv.com/news/kent-county/despite-districts-racial-equity-programs-black-family-recounts-problems/) from MLive also talks about some of the discrimination families in Forest Hills faced. The point of this whole history lesson is to explain the background behind Grand Rapids, and why things are the way they are. I also want to use this to point out that racism is very alive both in our history and our present. These things need to be written down, not erased, so we can (hopefully) learn from our past.

[^1]: It's a bit dubious if this quote was ever actually said, as the earliest record of it was 1966. The quote does randomly pop up from time to time, and even if it is not true, it makes a good point about many of the tensions and early relations in Grand Rapids. 
[^2]: The Wikipedia article [History of Grand Rapids Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Grand_Rapids,_Michigan#cite_note-Grand_Rapids_Historical_Perspective-1) in incorrect when listing Magdalene as "MÃ©tis" and not "mÃ©tis". Capital "M" MÃ©tis describes a person from the MÃ©tis Canadian tribe. Lower case "m" mÃ©tis denotes a person who is of both European and Native descent. Magdalene was both French and granddaughter of Chief Kewinoquot of the Odawa. 
[^3]: The quote is supposedly one made by Cobmoosa to Campau, and the earliest trace of such a quote was in an 1878 book. Again, there is no real way to really tell whether this quote was a real thing said, so take this with a grain of salt.
[^4]: The source (A History of Grand Rapids, 1891 by Albert Baxter pg 191) specifically states "leaving out 100 colored persons," implying that these people were not included in the general population of Grand Rapids, which raises the question of how these people were treated/viewed within the community itself. These numbers also don't match up with the Almy Bostwick pamphlets that list the 1840s population of Grand Rapids as 200,000.
[^5]: The Industrial Revolution in America: Iron and steel
[^6]: An interesting note that I found was that *Lipczynski* (Lip-chÃ­n-ski) would often be changed to Lipzinski, Lipginski, Lipchinski, Linski, andd Lipp. All much easier to type, but alas. We must stay true to history!
[^7]: There's a bit more to a sundown town than just that. James Loewen has an excellent book titled "Sundown Towns" that does an very good job covering the subject. The town in question could have non-white residents, but usually they lived in designated areas of the city. This segregation was often enforced by intimidation, violence, and through the local laws. These towns would also pressure people traveling through the town not to stop or stay for long.
[^8]: Although Lebenon didn't gain independence until the 1940s and most Grand Rapids newspapers referred to these people as "Syrians", I will be using the term that descendants of this community use today.
