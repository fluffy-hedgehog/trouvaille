Blodgett Home For Children Erected A.D. 1908.” However, the history of this building lies unseen by it’s grand exterior, and the story of many homeless, or otherwise ill provided for children remains reduced to numbers and news clippings. Many children were said to be left homeless due to typhus, diphtheria, scarlet fever and cholera outbreaks, leaving children malnourished and sick. Not much is documented about these children before such orphanages were built, and it’s likely that this part of history was erased as these children were not cared for and seen as a product of the city’s failures.\nThere were in fact two orphanages that existed in Grand Rapids, D.A. Blodgett Home For Children (who’s history begins in 1887) and St. John’s Home (begins in 1882). Both continued to serve the community to this day, although they’ve merged to form D.A. Blodgett St. Johns and now exists as a foster care, adoption, counseling, and mentoring facility.\nD.A. Blodgett Home For Children Beginning in 1887, a group of women in Grand Rapids came together to establish what would be known as the Children’s Home Society. On June 1892, the Society is incorporated under the names of 7 women, Anna Horton, Ellen L. Moore, Emma H. Strahan, Cora H. Sweet, Clara S. Morley, Lucia E. Colwell and Sara J. Davidson. It is to be noted that work was done by the Society before it’s incorporation, but much of it is either not documented or lost to history. The Society first met in Mrs. Sweet’s house, and eventually secured the interests of Delos Abiel Blodgett. The official D.A. Blodgett St. Johns website also describes Jennie Blodgett and Emily Clark planning the Children’s Aid Society and (in 1887) forming the Blodgett-Clark project at 42 Lafayette, but this is not noted in other sources, and is unclear if this is a separate society, or if this is simply an error either on the part of the D.A. Blodgett St. Johns or from Dwight Goss’s 1906 History of Grand Rapids. The Goss book seems to be the most commonly cited and accepted narrative. Another article from 1908 was also published in the Michigan Tradesman, and seems to match this narrative fairly closely.\nIn November 1892, Goss states that the Children’s Home Society, after attracting the attention of Mr. Blodgett, rented a house at 43 S. Lafayette, where they would continue to grow their work of receiving and distributed necessities to the community. Mr. Blodgett sent the first child there after receiving assurances that no child would be denied service due to “extreme infancy”. By August 1892, the Society had outgrown their former home, and, through the help of a $9,000 dollar donation from Mr. Blodgett and Mr. Melvin Clark removing $1000 from the price, they purchased the I.M. Clark Homestead on what would have been 666 Cherry St. 1 Mr. Clark and his heirs then donated $5,000 from the purchase back to the Society to use in their work. It seems the building purchased from Mr. Clark is not in fact the one that currently stands. Some time after the purchase was made, an advisory board was made, and the board recommended that the building be remodeled, under the direction of Mr. Blodgett, who payed for the majority of the Societies bills, especially in the early years. [See Who Payed For the Children’s Society?] By 1896, a full hospital was added to the Home.\nDate of photo: Unknown, Image courtesy of Migenweb.\nIn the first year in their new building, around 67 children were cared for. While two of them died in care, another 7 were taken into permanent homes, foreshadowing the foundation of the foster care system. After that, the Home cared for between 40 and 60 children each year. Dwight Goss writes,\n“Not all the inmates are abandoned and neglected children. Not infrequently a parent dies leaving one or more young children for whom the survivor can not keep up a household, and for such the Home is a place of refuge in time of need. The father leaves his child at the Home and gladly pays for its care; the mother, obliged to become a wage-earner, does the same. Sometimes the breadwinner of a family, by protracted illness or unusual misfortune, for a time is unable to provide for the little ones, and the Home takes the children until better times come to the broken family. The society has reunited many broken family ties and the gratitude of such households is unbounded. Often such households in prosperity have repaid with interest material aid received from the society in days of adversity.” (History of Grand Rapids and it’s Industries, 1906, pg 1259)\nPrograms Run by D.A. Blodgetts Children Home Multiple programs are recorded to have taken place here. One of the first was the distribution of breast milk to infants, which greatly decreased infant mortality, which is said to have garnered international attention. This was followed by the Clinic for Infant feeding, which reduced deaths in children under two years by 50% and deaths in babies under one year by 56%. This program eventually became part of the Community Health Service sometime before 1999.\nDate of photo: 1929, Image courtesy of Grand Rapids Public Library. To learn more visit History of Grand Rapids.\nThe Home also experienced 4 Scarlet Fever outbreaks in one year, and investigated the cost of such outbreaks. By 1911, the concluded the cost of one epidemic was $100,000, or $2,911,463.16 in 2021. The results of this study was said to have been published by the Russell Sage Foundation, but it is unclear if the study still exists. 2\nPerhaps one of the larges and most important programs that existed was the Foster Care program. The idea existed in the home as early as 1910, where the board wanted to place children into temporary boarding homes rather than keeping them in the Orphanage. By 1920, a social worker was hired to find placement for children, and by 1923 the program had gained momentum and was now a key program in the orphanage. In fact, this program was one of the first established programs in the United States to do foster care.\nOne other program (although never officially noted anywhere that I could find) was what seemed to be either a training or teaching program run at D.A. Blodgett Children’s Home in partnership with The School of Nursing. Of course, “School of Nursing doesn’t narrow down much at all, but it seems to be from the Blodgett Memorial Hospital (as seen in the second document displayed below). Esther Rehm, the sender of the first document, has a few published books and was a junior in the University of Michigan’s Nurse training school in the 1921-22 school year. The R.N. after her name further identifies her as a registered nurse. Miss Alice Brink is also listed as a nurse at the Blodgett Memorial Hospital in 1919, further linking the Orphanage to the hospital. It also makes sense that two Blodgett projects were closely associated.\nPhotos taken October 17, 2021 at the Main Grand Rapids Public Library.\nWho payed for the Children’s Home Society? The initial benefactors of the project were Delos Blodgett, and Melvin Clark, who both contributed substantially to the Society. Mr. Blodgett donated $9,000 dollars to help purchase the Clark Homestead, and Mr. Clark contributed around $6,000 by taking one grand off the price of the home and donating another 5 grand directly to the Home. Between it’s founding and 1906, the Children’s Home received around $4,000 dollars in donation from Miss Flora Stewart. In that time, they also received a total of $28,000 from Henry O. Schemerhorn (The Schemerhorn estate donated around $1,000 to $1,200 per year). Many other donations came from church societies, friends, and even just wealthy individuals. Guardians of the children in the home also sometimes payed as much as they could to cover the $4,000 dollar yearly expenses the Home experienced.\n   1892 Worth 2021 Worth     $1,000 $30,394.40   $5,000 $151,971.98   $10,000 $303,943.96   $28,000 $851,043.08    Officers and Advisory Board Incorporators: Anna Horton, Ellen C.

(Emily) Clark\nSt. John’s Orphan Asylum The second orphanage in Grand Rapids was run by the Dominican Sisters and was a Catholic institution. Every source talking about the Orphanage starts with John Clancy leaving $60,000 to the Bishop of Grand Rapids of the time, Bishop Henry J. Richter, in order to establish an Orphan Asylum. Although the Orphan Asylum has more concrete details than the Blodgett Home, there are less specifics on its founding. What we do know is that in 1888, 8 acres of land were purchased on East Leonard St. 2 and a half were then sold back to St. Alphonsus Church. An interesting thing to point out is that the original St. Alphonsus school was opened September of 1889, and could have been built on the land sold to the church. At 401 Leonard St. NE is the home of Mr. Clancy, facing the original site of the asylum.\nPhoto of a photo of St. John’s Orphan Asylum in it’s original building, before it was demolished in December, 1960\nOn August 25, 1889, the Asylum was dedicated and opened. By 1906, the asylum was run by 10 nuns. Courtesy of the Library’s record keeping, I’ve been able to find 4 Annual Reports that give numbers on the amount of money spent and the number of children served. By the 1940s, the number of children going through the facility had dropped from the 300s to the 100s. In the 1945-46 report, only 117 total children were taken care of, in comparison with the 300+ helped in earlier years. One factor could have been the increased emphasis on foster care. This would make sense if children placed in foster care were not counted as a part of the “total children”. If this is the case, St. John’s records match that of a trend across America, where the number of children in institutions/orphanages were steadily dropping with WWII, with the rise of the foster home. The St. John records also show a fairly dramatic increase in adoption, furthering this possibility. Another possibility was that the division of the diocese by Pope Pius XII (creating the diocese of Saginaw) reduced the number of children that were eligible to enter the facility. The children eligible to be placed into the orphanage were based on which diocese they lived in, a bit like a school district. Seeing as this decrease was quite dramatic, it would most likely require multiple factors together to create such an impact.\nPrograms in St. John’s The Orphanage had a number of different placements for children. The first was a boarding home, which is most similar to what is done today. In a boarding home, the family is paid for taking in children. The second option was a free home, where the family received no money for the children and took care of them through their own expenses. The final option was a wage home, an option not utilized much at all by the Orphanage. A wage home (or a wage-work home) requires the children in care to work in order to pay for their board. The only years where a wage home was actually utilized (in the 4 reports provided) was 1937-38, where 12 children were. The years before and after showed no use of wage homes, so it was most likely that the Home did not or could not find wage homes the majority of the time. Of course, most years there were more children in free homes than boarding homes. The final type of home is an adoptive home, most likely a type of permanent home.\nSt. John’s also noted the need to help single expecting mothers care for their children, as at the time they had 40 illegitimate children but only 6 expecting mothers in their care. They concluded that their work with mothers was not as successful as they would like it to be. They also stated that, due to staff limitations, they weren’t able to provide the necissary level of care to the children in the diocese and outisde of Kent County. Unfortunately, page 8 of the report is missing, so it’s difficult to figure out what the conclusion was. Either way, the Home was willing to admit their inabilities to the public in hopes of being able to fix the issue.\nPress Clipping on Expenses for the home (1995) Grand Rapids Press, 1995\nA Merger Meant to Be? Pardon me for borrowing D.A. Blodgett St. John’s heading in their history page, but I think it’s important to tie this gargantuan history lesson back to what is currently happening in Grand Rapids. In 2009, these two orphanages turned foster care programs united into the current program, D.A. Blodgett St. John’s, which exists as a standard childcare/foster care program. The things achieved by these (this?) organization have had a lasting impact on the community as they provided essential help to the young children and families in the community.\nThe biggest piece missing from this story, however, are the testimonies of children and families. Articles can write as much as they want about the good a program did, but nothing speaks louder than a first hand account. The lack of negative publications is a bit alarming. No program is entirely flawless. One of the only publications talking about either program at length was a 1995 article on St. John’s Home 3 that provided plenty of positive testimonials, which did encourage me to put more faith into the program. Many of the death rates dropping is obviously a good sign, but with the notorious issues of the foster care system published all over the media, and with incidents like the death of Ivan Aney in 2017, it’s important to ask if the program is as good as it can be, or whether it’s just been largely forgotten by anyone not involved. With almost 1,600 Michigan Youth aging out of foster care programs each year, only to find they aren’t prepared for the world, perhaps further research and change needs to take place.\nSources and Notes  St. John’s Orphan Asylum is the proper name of the original institution, but in the merger, it became D.A. Blodgett St. Johns. Some old postcards do list it as St. Johns (without the apostrophe). Institution, Orphanage and Home all are used interchangeably, since I could find no real difference in their use. “History of Grand Rapids” by Dwight Goss, published 1906, pg 1259 (Can be read digitally here)  An excellent source for a peek back into time. A weird thing here is that the website lists the book as from 1904, whereas the original one I read in the library was 1906. This could be an error, or simply an older version of the same book. Either way, the content remains unchanged.   History of the D.A. Blodgett Homes for Children (A portion can be read digitally here)  Another interesting source, with author and publication date unknown. The Digital Version actually has the portion I don’t have photos of, but the source gives a pretty good description of what happened in D.A. Blodgett throught the years   Michigan Tradesman, September 16, 1908, pg 2 (Read digitally here) “Our History”, D.A.

June 12, 1900 Census of St. John’s Home (Read transcribed version here)  Although not something I included in the article, this Census is an interesting piece of history that lists the people there in the home in 1900.   “Crisis of the American Orphanage”, Marshall B.

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever driven past and noticed the old orphanage on 920 Cherry St. SE, you might&rsquo;ve seen the huge columns or the engravings on the top reading &ldquo;D.A. Blodgett Home For Children Erected A.D. 1908.&rdquo; However, the history of this building lies unseen by it&rsquo;s grand exterior, and the story of many homeless, or otherwise ill provided for children remains reduced to numbers and news clippings. Many children were said to be left homeless due to typhus, diphtheria, scarlet fever and cholera outbreaks, leaving children malnourished and sick. Not much is documented about these children before such orphanages were built, and it&rsquo;s likely that this part of history was erased as these children were not cared for and seen as a product of the city&rsquo;s failures.</p>
<p>There were in fact two orphanages that existed in Grand Rapids, D.A. Blodgett Home For Children (who&rsquo;s history begins in 1887) and St. John&rsquo;s Home (begins in 1882). Both continued to serve the community to this day, although they&rsquo;ve merged to form D.A. Blodgett St. Johns and now exists as a foster care, adoption, counseling, and mentoring facility.</p>
<h2 id=da-blodgett-home-for-children>D.A. Blodgett Home For Children<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#da-blodgett-home-for-children>#</a></h2>
<p>Beginning in 1887, a group of women in Grand Rapids came together to establish what would be known as the Children&rsquo;s Home Society. On June 1892, the Society is incorporated under the names of 7 women, Anna Horton, Ellen L. Moore, Emma H. Strahan, Cora H. Sweet, Clara S. Morley, Lucia E. Colwell and Sara J. Davidson. It is to be noted that work was done by the Society before it&rsquo;s incorporation, but much of it is either not documented or lost to history. The Society first met in Mrs. Sweet&rsquo;s house, and eventually secured the interests of Delos Abiel Blodgett. The official D.A. Blodgett St. Johns website also describes Jennie Blodgett and Emily Clark planning the Children&rsquo;s Aid Society and (in 1887) forming the Blodgett-Clark project at 42 Lafayette, but this is not noted in other sources, and is unclear if this is a separate society, or if this is simply an error either on the part of the D.A. Blodgett St. Johns or from Dwight Goss&rsquo;s 1906 History of Grand Rapids. The Goss book seems to be the most commonly cited and accepted narrative. Another article from 1908 was also published in the Michigan Tradesman, and seems to match this narrative fairly closely.</p>

Some time after the purchase was made, an advisory board was made, and the board recommended that the building be remodeled, under the direction of Mr. Blodgett, who payed for the majority of the Societies bills, especially in the early years. [See Who Payed For the Children&rsquo;s Society?] By 1896, a full hospital was added to the Home.</p>

<p>In the first year in their new building, around 67 children were cared for. While two of them died in care, another 7 were taken into permanent homes, foreshadowing the foundation of the foster care system. After that, the Home cared for between 40 and 60 children each year. Dwight Goss writes,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all the inmates are abandoned and neglected children. Not infrequently a parent dies leaving one or more young children for whom the survivor can not keep up a household, and for such the Home is a place of refuge in time of need. The father leaves his child at the Home and gladly pays for its care; the mother, obliged to become a wage-earner, does the same. Sometimes the breadwinner of a family, by protracted illness or unusual misfortune, for a time is unable to provide for the little ones, and the Home takes the children until better times come to the broken family. The society has reunited many broken family ties and the gratitude of such households is unbounded. Often such households in prosperity have repaid with interest material aid received from the society in days of adversity.&rdquo; (History of Grand Rapids and it&rsquo;s Industries, 1906, pg 1259)</p>

<p>Multiple programs are recorded to have taken place here. One of the first was the distribution of breast milk to infants, which greatly decreased infant mortality, which is said to have garnered international attention. This was followed by the Clinic for Infant feeding, which reduced deaths in children under two years by 50% and deaths in babies under one year by 56%. This program eventually became part of the Community Health Service sometime before 1999.</p>

<p>The Home also experienced 4 Scarlet Fever outbreaks in one year, and investigated the cost of such outbreaks. By 1911, the concluded the cost of one epidemic was $100,000, or $2,911,463.16 in 2021. The results of this study was said to have been published by the Russell Sage Foundation, but it is unclear if the study still exists. <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps one of the larges and most important programs that existed was the Foster Care program. The idea existed in the home as early as 1910, where the board wanted to place children into temporary boarding homes rather than keeping them in the Orphanage. By 1920, a social worker was hired to find placement for children, and by 1923 the program had gained momentum and was now a key program in the orphanage. In fact, this program was one of the first established programs in the United States to do foster care.</p>
<p>One other program (although never officially noted anywhere that I could find) was what seemed to be either a training or teaching program run at D.A. Blodgett Children&rsquo;s Home in partnership with The School of Nursing. Of course, &ldquo;School of Nursing doesn&rsquo;t narrow down much at all, but it seems to be from the Blodgett Memorial Hospital (as seen in the second document displayed below). Esther Rehm, the sender of the first document, has a few published books and was a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=cD0qAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA799&lpg=PA799&dq=esther+h+rehm&source=bl&ots=eBOckAYDXu&sig=ACfU3U2GNpOecJxPqyqwoOaynnd04Cad0Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi56JWXmvr0AhWLlYkEHeNpAtAQ6AF6BAgQEAM#v=onepage&q=esther%20h%20rehm&f=false">junior in the University of Michigan&rsquo;s</a> Nurse training school in the 1921-22 school year. The R.N. after her name further identifies her as a registered nurse. Miss Alice Brink is also <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wsk5AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA287&lpg=RA1-PA287&dq=%22alice+brink%22+grand+rapids&source=bl&ots=CZZwB4AN2Q&sig=ACfU3U21V9MBwq3z3QRdSLiP784BGT7foQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX9JT8m_r0AhX_k4kEHbdJAmEQ6AF6BAgMEAM#v=onepage&q=%22alice%20brink%22%20grand%20rapids&f=false">listed as a nurse</a> at the Blodgett Memorial Hospital in 1919, further linking the Orphanage to the hospital. It also makes sense that two Blodgett projects were closely associated.</p>

<p>The initial benefactors of the project were Delos Blodgett, and Melvin Clark, who both contributed substantially to the Society. Mr. Blodgett donated $9,000 dollars to help purchase the Clark Homestead, and Mr. Clark contributed around $6,000 by taking one grand off the price of the home and donating another 5 grand directly to the Home. Between it&rsquo;s founding and 1906, the Children&rsquo;s Home received around $4,000 dollars in donation from Miss Flora Stewart. In that time, they also received a total of $28,000 from Henry O. Schemerhorn (The Schemerhorn estate donated around $1,000 to $1,200 per year). Many other donations came from church societies, friends, and even just wealthy individuals. Guardians of the children in the home also sometimes payed as much as they could to cover the $4,000 dollar yearly expenses the Home experienced.</p>

<h2 id=st-johns-orphan-asylum>St. John&rsquo;s Orphan Asylum<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#st-johns-orphan-asylum>#</a></h2>
<p>The second orphanage in Grand Rapids was run by the Dominican Sisters and was a Catholic institution. Every source talking about the Orphanage starts with John Clancy leaving $60,000 to the Bishop of Grand Rapids of the time, Bishop Henry J. Richter, in order to establish an Orphan Asylum. Although the Orphan Asylum has more concrete details than the Blodgett Home, there are less specifics on its founding. What we do know is that in 1888, 8 acres of land were purchased on East Leonard St. 2 and a half were then sold back to St. Alphonsus Church. An interesting thing to point out is that the original St. Alphonsus school was opened September of 1889, and could have been built on the land sold to the church. At 401 Leonard St. NE is the home of Mr. Clancy, facing the original site of the asylum.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/stjohnscastleasylum.jpg alt="Original St. John&amp;rsquo;s Orphan Asylum Building">
<em>Photo of a photo of St. John&rsquo;s Orphan Asylum in it&rsquo;s original building, before it was demolished in December, 1960</em></p>
<p>On August 25, 1889, the Asylum was dedicated and opened. By 1906, the asylum was run by 10 nuns. Courtesy of the Library&rsquo;s record keeping, I&rsquo;ve been able to find 4 <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16aSumWY0mMeGRp-JeTWJeWjZIg_OACEe?usp=sharing">Annual Reports</a> that give numbers on the amount of money spent and the number of children served. By the 1940s, the number of children going through the facility had dropped from the 300s to the 100s. In the 1945-46 report, only 117 total children were taken care of, in comparison with the 300+ helped in earlier years. One factor could have been the increased emphasis on foster care. This would make sense if children placed in foster care were not counted as a part of the &ldquo;total children&rdquo;. If this is the case, St. John&rsquo;s records match that of a trend across America, where the number of children in institutions/orphanages were steadily dropping with WWII, with the rise of the foster home. The St. John records also show a fairly dramatic increase in adoption, furthering this possibility. Another possibility was that the division of the diocese by Pope Pius XII (creating the diocese of Saginaw) reduced the number of children that were eligible to enter the facility. The children eligible to be placed into the orphanage were based on which diocese they lived in, a bit like a school district. Seeing as this decrease was quite dramatic, it would most likely require multiple factors together to create such an impact.</p>
<h3 id=programs-in-st-johns>Programs in St. John&rsquo;s<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#programs-in-st-johns>#</a></h3>
<p>The Orphanage had a number of different placements for children. The first was a boarding home, which is most similar to what is done today. In a boarding home, the family is paid for taking in children. The second option was a free home, where the family received no money for the children and took care of them through their own expenses. The final option was a wage home, an option not utilized much at all by the Orphanage. A wage home (or a wage-work home) requires the children in care to work in order to pay for their board. The only years where a wage home was actually utilized (in the 4 reports provided) was 1937-38, where 12 children were. The years before and after showed no use of wage homes, so it was most likely that the Home did not or could not find wage homes the majority of the time. Of course, most years there were more children in free homes than boarding homes. The final type of home is an adoptive home, most likely a type of permanent home.</p>
<p>St. John&rsquo;s also noted the need to help single expecting mothers care for their children, as at the time they had 40 illegitimate children but only 6 expecting mothers in their care. They concluded that their work with mothers was not as successful as they would like it to be. They also stated that, due to staff limitations, they weren&rsquo;t able to provide the necissary level of care to the children in the diocese and outisde of Kent County. Unfortunately, page 8 of the report is missing, so it&rsquo;s difficult to figure out what the conclusion was. Either way, the Home was willing to admit their inabilities to the public in hopes of being able to fix the issue.</p>

<p>Pardon me for borrowing D.A. Blodgett St. John&rsquo;s heading in their history page, but I think it&rsquo;s important to tie this gargantuan history lesson back to what is currently happening in Grand Rapids. In 2009, these two orphanages turned foster care programs united into the current program, D.A. Blodgett St. John&rsquo;s, which exists as a standard childcare/foster care program. The things achieved by these (this?) organization have had a lasting impact on the community as they provided essential help to the young children and families in the community.</p>
<p>The biggest piece missing from this story, however, are the testimonies of children and families. Articles can write as much as they want about the good a program did, but nothing speaks louder than a first hand account. The lack of negative publications is a bit alarming. No program is entirely flawless. One of the only publications talking about either program at length was a 1995 article on St. John&rsquo;s Home <sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> that provided plenty of positive testimonials, which did encourage me to put more faith into the program. Many of the death rates dropping is obviously a good sign, but with the notorious issues of the foster care system published all over the media, and with incidents like the death of <a href=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2017/03/teens_suicide_brings_lawsuit_a.html>Ivan Aney in 2017</a>, it&rsquo;s important to ask if the program is as good as it can be, or whether it&rsquo;s just been largely forgotten by anyone not involved. With almost 1,600 Michigan Youth aging out of foster care programs each year, only to find they aren&rsquo;t prepared for the world, perhaps further research and change needs to take place.</p>
