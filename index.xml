The news was no exception. Due to this gap, some took to starting their own news platforms and newspapers. Because of their ties to the New Left and their lack of backing by existing establishments, these papers garnered their own name: The Underground Press. While some, like the New River Free Press, disliked the label for it&amp;rsquo;s negative connotations, others, like the Root, embraced it.</description></item><item><title>Patchwork: A History of Immigration and Segregation in Grand Rapids</title><link>https://fluffy-hedgehog.github.io/trouvaille/posts/immigration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fluffy-hedgehog.github.io/trouvaille/posts/immigration/</guid><description>When I chose to write about Immigration as the first step of my project to learn about Grand Rapids, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect it to be something easy. However, at the same time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect it to be quite as difficult. In the initial batch of research that I did, I came away with a very patchwork understanding on the cultures and neighborhoods that came together to form the city. Each article that I read only gave me a look on a specific group of people, a set of facts, or even just a name.</description></item><item><title>The Roots of Music and Entertainment</title><link>https://fluffy-hedgehog.github.io/trouvaille/posts/entertainment/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fluffy-hedgehog.github.io/trouvaille/posts/entertainment/</guid><description>Of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the roots of music or entertainment in a macro sense, that would be a bit far from the purpose of this project. Rather, I mean the roots of the establishments that provided entertainment to the Rapidians, from then to now. With many established communities, entertainment was the next step in a growing city. As the entertainment sphere changed across America, many of these things were reflected in Grand Rapids.</description></item><item><title>The Orphan Children of Grand Rapids</title><link>https://fluffy-hedgehog.github.io/trouvaille/posts/grorphanages/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fluffy-hedgehog.github.io/trouvaille/posts/grorphanages/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever driven past and noticed the old orphanage on 920 Cherry St. SE, you might&amp;rsquo;ve seen the huge columns or the engravings on the top reading &amp;ldquo;D.A. Blodgett Home For Children Erected A.D. 1908.&amp;rdquo; However, the history of this building lies unseen by it&amp;rsquo;s grand exterior, and the story of many homeless, or otherwise ill provided for children remains reduced to numbers and news clippings. Many children were said to be left homeless due to typhus, diphtheria, scarlet fever and cholera outbreaks, leaving children malnourished and sick.</description></item><item><title>contact</title><link>https://fluffy-hedgehog.github.io/trouvaille/posts/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fluffy-hedgehog.github.io/trouvaille/posts/contact/</guid><description>Looking to contact me about something on this website?
